# Loki Logging Provider

Send logs directly to Grafana Loki from your .NET 5 application.

The Loki Logging Provider is primarily intended for situations where scraping console logs is not an option such as when you are developing your application locally.

This project is currently experimental however it is intended to eventually be release as a NuGet package which you can download and consume in your own .NET application.
